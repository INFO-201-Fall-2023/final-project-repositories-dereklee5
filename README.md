## Story Pitch

With ocean waters continuing to rise in temperature due to climate change, many adverse effects have been observed as a result. Marine life has been irreversibly decimated – coral reefs providing shelter and food for marine species have been destroyed, microscopic organisms such as plankton that are sensitive to temperature changes have died off, and animals up the food chain like whales that feed off of these microscopic organisms will suffer from starvation. Warming sea waters result in ice loss in polar regions, increasing sea levels. Rising sea levels are known to exacerbate catastrophic events like cyclones, landslides, deadly storms, and flooding, endangering human populations as well. Because of these consequences, it’s unsurprising that many people have united to raise awareness to this matter and protest for change.


In addition to the detrimental change in ocean water conditions, the United States has observed a dramatic increase in mental health issues across the country. More Americans than ever have reported feelings of social isolation and loneliness, and this was only amplified during the COVID-19 pandemic. These symptoms of psychological distress have been linked to depression, anxiety, PTSD, and even suicidal ideation. This rise in mental health conditions is alarming, severely impairing the well-being and liveliness of millions of Americans. As more people have become aware of the significance of the mental health crisis in America, there hasn’t been a clear consensus as to what has caused this issue.


While both of these issues have been occurring simultaneously, many people fail to recognize a strong correlation between the two. You wouldn’t necessarily think that the #SavetheTurtles movement and the growing surge in recognizing the importance of mental health are related at first glance. However, we are hoping to change the narrative and draw a correlation between changing ocean water conditions and mental health outcomes. In spite of the fact that a growing pressure has been placed on national governments to combat climate change and reverse the impacts of industrialization on ocean waters, fewer efforts have been focused on how climate change affects individuals and their well-being. While the health of the earth we live on should be a priority, individuals struggle to acknowledge how they’ve been personally impacted by global warming, especially since their carbon footprint is microscopic relative to that of corporations. By analyzing the correlation in data on changing ocean water conditions and increasing mental health issues across the United States throughout the years, we hope to answer the question of how one’s environment can dictate and influence one’s mental wellbeing. 


Through our project, we hope to spread light on the impact that a change in ocean water conditions can have on the mental health of Americans. Our project takes a unique perspective by highlighting the overlooked aspects and consequences of the climate crisis and how it affects individuals in their everyday life, urging more people to take action and address the destructive nature of these two issues.


## Finding Data

### Dataset 1

#### Where did you download:
[GLODAP Pacific Ocean](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/data/oceans/ncei/ocads/data/0210813)
[GLODAP infographic](https://www.glodap.info/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/ReleasePoster_v2_2022.pdf)

#### How data was collected:
This data was collected from numerous NOAA sources and conglomerated by the Global Ocean Data Analysis Project (GLODAP). It contains statistics specifically on the Pacific Ocean from 1993 to 2018. Information includes precisely where and at what time the data was collected (latitude, longitude, month/day/hour/minute, pressure, depth) as well as the temperature, salinity, pH, and chemical levels. 

#### Rows/Observations:
There are 510688 rows of data. 

#### Columns/Features:
There are 105 columns of data.

### Dataset 2

#### Where did you download:
For our second dataset, we downloaded a dataset with geospatial data of mental health in the United States population between 2011 and 2015. [US Mental Health Geospatial Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/b37tk3xbyt/1)

#### How data was collected:
The data was collected by the National Survey of Drug Use and Health and was initially collected to demonstrate a correlation between drug usage and population mental health. It examines symptoms of depression, suicidal thinking, and overall severe and debilitating mental illnesses. 

#### Rows/Observations:
There are 787 rows of data

#### Columns/Features:
There are 42 columns of data

## Background Research/Inspiration

### [Water and mental health - Wutich - 2020 - WIREs Water - Wiley Online Library](https://wires.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/wat2.1461)
- While we are looking for evidence that global warming yields environmental effects that consequently impact mental health, this article points to the connection between water insecurity and how those outcomes take a toll on mental health
- The article sources two different studies, one of which successfully connected quality water access to an increase in time gains, social integration, and quality of life while reducing the conflict caused by water insecurity

### [Oceans and society: feedbacks between ocean and human health - SpringerLink](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11160-021-09669-5)
- This article agrees with our project proposal as it describes the feedback loop between human health and ocean health
- Takes the standpoint that ocean stewardship promotes desirable ocean health, which returns valuable outputs such as seafood, resources, energy, climate buffering, recreation, and more, which in turn may promote better physical and mental health

### [Nature and mental health: An ecosystem service perspective - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6656547/)
- Contrasts by taking into account the idea that contact with nature and the quality of that contact is at least partly determined by economic factors; income inequality affects where you live (ie city vs. suburban, clean air, etc.) and thus if your environment is more clean and you have better access to clean outdoor spaces, your mental health may be better 
- Supports project stance by citing numerous cross-sectional studies and experimental fieldwork that shows the benefits of nature experience on mental health by improving sleep and decreasing stress

### [How climate change affects mental health - Yale Climate Connections](https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2020/02/how-climate-change-affects-mental-health/)
- Agrees that global warming increasing the likelihood of disasters that can lead to distress reactions and prolonged mental health disorders such as anxiety and PTSD, even if it is by indirect exposure (seeing the news, a 
- States that there have been correlations found between poor air quality/high temperature and behavior, such as increased suicide, anxiety, schizophrenia, and personality disorder 

### [Ocean Acidification and Human Health - PMC (nih.gov)](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7344635/)
- Investigates the effect of ocean acidification on several aspects of human health, including mental health. Argues that although most assume ocean acidification only affects marine life, there are also significant potential effects on human health.
- Points out several specific factors that will affect humans. Loss of fish diversity/population will put social pressures on those reliant on ocean based jobs. Habitat loss will reduce ocean-based recreational activities available for everyone, losing a point of social activity and furthering us from nature (which is potentially important for mental health based on biophilia hypothesis). Those with connection to nature generally are less motivated to protect it, so a feedback loop can occur where people become more distanced to nature due to growing climate issues and become less motivated to fix it.

### [Mental Health Risk Assesssments - Mental Health America](https://mhanational.org/mhamapping/mha-state-county-data)
- This dashboard visualizes geospatial data from over four million mental health screenings that have taken place in the United States from 2020-2022. Similar to our project idea, it visualizes data on mental health issues such as depression, PTSD, suicide, trauma, and psychosis to illustrate a story about mental health in the United States.
- Contrasting to our project, this dashboard only looks at data in the span of two years while our project examines data over four years. The dashboard also only compares data between states while our project aims to use regional and geospatial data throughout the United States and the ocean.
